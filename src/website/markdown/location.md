The building has a sign for **â˜¤ CHCP College** on the East side of the building.

##### Directions from 290

Take the exit for Mangum Rd, Dacoma St, then turn left onto Dacoma St.  At the
end of Dacoma St, turn right onto T. C. Jester Blvd and right again onto North
Loop West.  The building will be on the right.

**Note:** At time of writing, Google Maps will route you to 610, and then take
exit 13 B.  This is not reasonably possible; you will have to take the
following exit and double back.

##### Directions from 610 North Loop

Take exit 13 B for T. C. Jester Blvd.  The building will be on the right after
passing T. C. Jester Blvd.

##### Directions from 610 West Loop

Take exit 13 B for T. C. Jester Blvd, then take the turnaround at T. C. Jester
Blvd.  The building will be on the right.

#### Social Gatherings

After the meetings, around 9:30 p.m., we have a social gathering at Cedar Creek
Bar & Grill.
