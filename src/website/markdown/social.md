### Social Gatherings

These meetings involve eating and drinking in the company of Linux minded people.
The topics rarely stay on Linux proper, buf flow with whatever the group is
interested in at the moment.  It's a great way to network with Linux loving peers.

#### Cedar Creek Wednesday Meetup

> Cedar Creek <br/>
> Wednesdays, 9:30 P.M. to 12:00 A.M. <br/>
> 1034 W 20th St, Houston, TX 77008 <br/>
> (713) 808-9623 <br/>

Typically four to eight members drive over to Cedar Creek after the support
meeting.  If the weather is nice, we get a table outside.  

Along with a full bar and decent beer selection, Cedar Creek offers good
hamburgers and smothered fries.

Accomodations for computers are sparse, but if you wish to bring a laptop, be
prepared to tether to your phone for wifi, and have a battery charge.
