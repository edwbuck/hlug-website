# Welcome Linux Users

  The Houston Linux User's Group is the place for Linux activity in Houston.
  Whether you are looking to socialize with Linux loving peers, promote the
  adoption of Linux in a particular venue, or learn about Linux and its
  software offerings, the Houston Linux User's Group can assist you in achieving
  your goals, with Linux!

  The Houston Linux User Group's mission is based on four pillars.

## Advocacy

    Getting Linux in front of people that might benefit from using it.

## Education

  Assiting people who want to know more about Linux

## Support

  Assisting people who have started something Linux, and need a helping hand.

## Socializing

  Having fun doing all, some, or none of the above.  Letting people connect in person,
  that share a common bond, even if that bond is an operating system.

## Background

The Houston Linux Users Group was founded in 1995.  With 30 years of
computing history, the group has transitioned with the needs of the computing
community.

One of the most active computer groups in Houston, the Houston Linux Users
Group has been meeting weekly for the past three decades.  With a breadth and
depth of computing experience rarely found elsewhere, the group has helped
individuals use and leverage Linux in a large number of ways.

If you intend to learn system administration, set up a website, develop
a new application, we have members that can share their expeirences with you.
If you seek to or build a back-end system; or group contains professionals
from the Houston area that can point out trial and pitfalls, assiting you toward
your goals.
