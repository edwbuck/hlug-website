### Support Gatherings

These meetings provide support for Linux people needing assistance with:

* Installing Linux on new hardware.
* Improving or fixing a Linux installation.
* Questions about how Linux works.
* Questions / assistance with Linux security.
* Linux software suggestions.

Members meet to both offer support and ask for it.  We generally have a diverse
enough group to attempt any problem, and have answered thousands of general use
problems (and fixed hundreds of WiFi card issues) over the years.
