### Advocacy Gatherings

Advocacy is one of the four pillars of our mission.  By letting others
know of Linux and how it can help their lives, we hope to gain more Linux
users.  While Linux has already spread throughout the server room and into
the cloud, we seek to help people find new uses of Linux and Linux technology
in areas where it can transfer more control back to the user, providing
efficient, oost-effective, and performant computing at a minimal cost.

Throughout the year we target four Advocacy initiatives.  If you are
interested in being an ambassador of the Houston Linux User Group and wish
to promote the use of Linux to those that might know little about the 
technology, or might know about the technology but have yet to use it, please
sign up for one of our Advocay Meetings and 

These effort involve promoting Linux and the Houston Linux User Group.  
They typically involve Linux awareness, group meeting times, and handling
general questions about Linux and current popular computing topics.
They are a great way to meet new people, and understand the needs of
computer users.
