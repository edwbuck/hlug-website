### Educational Gatherings

These meetings involve learning about Linux, and computer related topics.
They typically involve a person giving a presentation, but also extend to
one on one coaching, mentoring, or teaching.  They are a great way to gain
exposure to current computing topics, improve understanding of a current
system, or gain understaning in a new area of computing.

#### Lecutures and Presentations

Some of the Wednesday Lab meetings come with a presentation.  In addition
to food, drink, and support, one of our members may give twenty minute talk.  

We also host five minute ligtning talks.

For information about the talks, reqeusts for topics to be presented, or to
offer your talk, please contact Edwin Buck.

#### Coaching

For those who have an interest in a broad area of Linux, and could use
occasional assistence in persuing their learning goals, the Houston Linux
Users Group provides coaching services.  These services will have one of
our experienced members track your progress, and provide occasional
assistance when small problems in your self-directed learning falter.

#### One on One Teaching

For those looking for deep knowledge in a specific topic, with a member
helping to direct the learning, a few members provide a directed path
toward achieving their learning goals.  These services are not available
for all topics, and are limited based on member availability.
